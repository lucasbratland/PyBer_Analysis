# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the PyBer analysis
We are a new data analyst at the Pyber, a ride sharing company. Our first task is to preform some emploratory analysis on some ride share data from 2019. The CEO loves looking at visualizations, so we will be using matplotlib to create these. 
There are 3 city types that we will be looking at: Rural, Suburban and Urban. Amongst these 3 city types we will be looking at the following areas:
1. Total Rides
2. Total Drivers
3. Total Fares
4. Average Fare per Ride
5. Average Fare per Driver
6. Total Fare by City Type over the four months of data

## Resources
- Data Sources: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Jupyter Notebook (python, pandas, matplotlib, dataframe_image), VS Code

## Results
The next 5 sections will refer to this table
